            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Wehsing is from Rotterdam in The Netherlands. Before he played Dota 2, SingSing played StarCraft II, Heroes of Newerth, and DotA 1.</p>
            <h2>Dota 2</h2>
            <p>SingSing gained access early in the Dota 2 beta and with that he started streaming regularly. His often troll-oriented streaming style quickly got him attention from streamviewers and he quickly became one of the most watched streamers. In December 2011 SingSing, along with his teammates in what used to be called "EBIN", got picked up by mousesports quickly getting results winning two events hosted by The GD Studio. After changing the entire roster, except for SingSing, the team managed to qualify for The International 2012 by beating World Elite when MUFC failed to show up.<br><br>After The International 2012 it first looked like SingSing would stay with mousesports, in October 2012 it was announced that The GD Studio would sponsor the teams trip to Star Ladder Finals since mousesports decided to part ways with the team. SingSing then represented The GD B-Team for the tournament but it was made clear this was a one time thing and that the team would have to find a new sponsor. After briefly calling his team Zero, SingSing left in early November 2012. On December 31, he announced a new team of his, coming "soon". On the first of February, QPAD's Facebook announced a new team, the QPAD Dragons (later changed to Red Pandas), containing both SingSing and Wagamama as core members.<br><br>Shortly after The International 2013 he joined Kaipi, who he previously played for as a stand-in.<br><br>Kaipi was picked up by the international organization RattleSnake and formed RattleSnake.int. The team was later renamed to Speed Gaming, to give it a more solid identity throughout the community. Following issues with their manager, the team left to join the Cloud9 organization. On August 13th, 2014, SingSing left Cloud9 to join a new team, while playing for Team Tinker for i-league. Following a string of disappointing results, SingSing departed Team Tinker in February of 2015. He went on to form a new team, Burden United, to participate in the ESL One Frankfurt 2015 qualifiers. After failing to qualify for The International 2015, Burden United disbanded and SingSing was left teamless. Singsing returned to his former team Kaipi on 14th March 2016.<br><br>After falling short in the Boston Major American Open Qualifers, SingSing announced his retirement during an interview, where he cited that the open qualifiers would be his last tournament. Afterwards Kaipi later disbanded.<br><br></p>
